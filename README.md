## Instructions

### First Try Terraform Only

In the `Terraform_Only/environments/dev` folder create a private/public key pair with an empty passphrase:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f mykey-pair
sudo chmod 400 mykey-pair
```

In order to create a remote backend to store Terraform state files, you will need to create an S3 bucket and a Dynamo DB table. This is a good guide: https://www.golinuxcloud.com/configure-s3-bucket-as-terraform-backend/#:~:text=Configure%20S3%20bucket%20as%20Terraform%20backend%20%5BStep-by-Step%5D%201,Configure%20Terraform%20to%20point%20to%20this%20backend%20

Run Terraform commands

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Finally Try Terragrunt

In the `Terragrunt/environments/dev` folder run the following command to create a private/public key pair with an empty passphrase:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f mykey-pair
sudo chmod 400 mykey-pair
```

Then run the following terragrunt commands:

```bash
terragrunt init
terragrunt plan
terragrunt apply
```

Terragrunt sets the AWS remote backend for you. It will create an S3 bucket and a Dynamo DB table.

## Clean Up

Terragrunt has a neat feature that allows you to run commands across multiple folders. In our case we will run the following command to destroy the dev and prod environments:

```bash
@nholuongut âžœ /workspaces/env0-terragrunt/Terragrunt/environments (main) $ terragrunt run-all destroy
```
